mapBrain
===================
A librrary to perform **Spherical Brain Mapping** on a 3D Brain Image. 

The **Spherical Brain Mapping** (SBM) is a framework intended to map the internal structures and features of the brain onto a 2D image that summarizes all this information, as described in [1] and [2]. 

Installation

Usage
-----------------
The Statistical Brain Mapping is structured as a class that can be invoked from every script. The simplest approach would be using: 
```python
import mapBrain
import nibabel as nib

img = nib.load('MRIimage.nii')
sbm = mapBrain.SphericalBrainMapping()
map = sbm.doSBM(img.get_data(), measure='average', show=True)
```
